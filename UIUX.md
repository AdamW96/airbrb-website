1. When creating a listing, we use the step form in the front-end design, Users need to fill in information page by page, this is more user friendly than using a single form to fill in all information.

2. The buttons on the website are well positioned and easily recognisable by the user. The buttons are clearly labelled to help users distinguish their function. Also some of the buttons appear only after the user has performed certain actions, so that there is no confusion for the user. For example, the comment button and the delete booking button appear only after a booking has been made, so that the user is aware that they can post a comment after booking.

3. For each step the user takes, if an error is generated, the user is alerted to the error as well as being told how to do it correctly. Ensure that every action taken by the user is responded to on the page.

4. We have designed some other features which are not mentioned in the guideline but which make the user experience even better. For example, calculating the average score for a particular listing. Allowing the user to cancel a booking after it has been booked.

5. Edge testing is included in all features of the site. We test all edge data, so a greater degree of user customisation is allowed without crashing the site.

6. We have designed responsive access. Smaller interfaces ( e.g. iPhone 5) remain beautiful and user-friendly.
